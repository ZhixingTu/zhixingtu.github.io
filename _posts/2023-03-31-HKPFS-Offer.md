The journey towards academic success can be both challenging and rewarding. For many students, securing prestigious scholarships, such as the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS), is a dream come true. I am honored to be kindly offered this fellowship, and would like to thank Dr. Xianghao YU for his unwavering support and guidance.

The journey towards securing HKPFS began with an extensive and rigorous application process. From preparing a comprehensive research proposal to gathering reference letters and attending interviews, each step was crucial in showcasing my passion for research and dedication to academic excellence. It was during this time that Dr. Xianghao Yu's guidance became invaluable.

My gratitude towards Prof. Xianghao Yu is immense. He patiently answered my questions, offered constructive feedback, and challenged me to think critically. His dedication to my success was evident in the countless hours he spent reviewing my drafts and providing insightful suggestions.
