After several weeks of peace, the plague stages a comeback.



Recent days we have heard about lots of colleagues and their roommates being affected by `Influenza A`, which can lead to a fever, dizziness, or fatigue. With no significant clue that the coronavirus is comming back, I am pretty sure that the spread of plague is much more severe than before. Take care and be well since it may last for a long time.
